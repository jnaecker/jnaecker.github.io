### [Do Hypothetical Choices and Non-Choice Ratings Reveal Preferences?](http://stanford.io/18FWUs5) 

with [B. Douglas Bernheim](http://bit.ly/v9HWVP), [Daniel Bjorkgren](http://bit.ly/vhlbDW), and [Antonio Rangel](http://bit.ly/sIaX6q)

We develop a method for determining likely responses to a change in some economic condition (e.g., a policy) for settings in which either similar changes have not been observed, or it is challenging to identify observable exogenous causes of past changes. The method involves estimating statistical relationships across decision problems between choice frequencies and variables measuring non-choice reactions, and using those relationships along with additional non-choice data to predict choice frequencies under the envisioned conditions. In an experimental setting, we demonstrate that this method yields accurate measures of behavioral responses, while more standard methods are either inapplicable or highly inaccurate.

### [Demand for Commitment: Time Inconsistency or Signaling?](http://bit.ly/commitmentpaper)

with [Christine Exley](http://bit.ly/LvZOyU)

Previous research often views demand for commitment devices -- the option to restrict oneâ€™s future opportunity set -- as a smoking gun for sophisticated time-inconsistency. We propose an alternative explanation for such behavior: commitment devices allow individuals to signal attributes about them- selves to others. In this paper, we present results from a field experiment where participants could choose to give up money if they did not follow through with a planned action; their choice was either kept private or publicly revealed. There is strong demand for commitment in the private treatment, which is indicative of at least some participants being time-inconsistent sophisticates. However, we find significantly higher demand for commitment in the public treatment. This phenomenon is consistent with a signaling motive, wherein participants believe that they can reveal something positive about themselves by choosing the commitment device. More generally, our results indicate that time inconsistency alone may not explain the demand for commitment, particularly in situations where there is an important role for signaling.

### Comparing the Predictive Power of Utility-based Models and Machine Learning Methods in Choice Under Uncertainty

with [Alex Peysakhovich](http://bit.ly/1dbjVS9)

Economists study individual choices by assuming utility maximization. Utility based approaches have several advantages in theory (e.g. they are interpretable and also easy to plug in to larger models such as those of markets). However, they require the imposition of heroic assumptions about the functional form utility can take. If these assumptions are strongly violated, then predictions of utility-based models may be very misleading. In this paper, we compare the predictive performance of economic models of choice under uncertainty to the performance of machine learning (ML) based methods which are less interpretable, but make much fewer functional form assumptions. We find that both ML and economic models are able to predict willingness to pay for risky prospects relatively well. In particular, we show that expected utility theory with probability weighting (a function with 2 parameters for each individual) is able to match the predictive performance of L1 regularized regression and even out-perform the ML model when the number of training decisions per individual is relatively low. In our second experiment we examine the domain of decisions under ambiguity: uncertain decisions where probabilities of outcomes are unknown by the decision-maker. Here L1 regularized regression outperforms commonly used utility-based models. This final result suggests that there is room for theoretical developments in building a better simple-to-use utility-based ambiguity aversion model.
