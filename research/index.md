## Working Papers

#### [Do Hypothetical Choices and Non-Choice Ratings Reveal Preferences?](http://stanford.edu/~jnaecker/files/research/non-choice.pdf){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Research', 'Download', this.href);"}

with B. Douglas Bernheim, Daniel Bjorkgren, and Antonio Rangel

We develop a method for determining likely responses to a change in some economic condition (e.g., a policy) for settings in which either similar changes have not been observed, or it is challenging to identify observable exogenous causes of past changes. The method involves estimating statistical relationships across decision problems between choice frequencies and variables measuring non-choice reactions, and using those relationships along with additional non-choice data to predict choice frequencies under the envisioned conditions. In an experimental setting, we demonstrate that this method yields accurate measures of behavioral responses, while more standard methods are either inapplicable or highly inaccurate.

#### [Observability Increases the Demand for Commitment Devices](http://stanford.edu/~jnaecker/files/research/commitment.pdf){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Research', 'Download', this.href);"} **\[under review\]**

with Christine Exley

Previous research has viewed the choice to restrict one's future opportunity set as evidence for sophisticated time-inconsistency. We propose an additional mechanism: commitment devices allow individuals to signal to others. We present a field experiment where participants could choose to give up money if they did not follow through with an action. We find significantly higher demand for commitment if their choice was made public rather than kept private, suggesting that participants believe they can reveal something positive about themselves by using the device.

#### Comparing the Predictive Power of Utility-based Models and Machine Learning Methods in Choice Under Uncertainty

with Alex Peysakhovich

Economists study individual choices by assuming utility maximization. Utility based approaches have several advantages in theory (e.g. they are interpretable and also easy to plug in to larger models such as those of markets). However, they require the imposition of heroic assumptions about the functional form utility can take. If these assumptions are strongly violated, then predictions of utility-based models may be very misleading. In this paper, we compare the predictive performance of economic models of choice under uncertainty to the performance of machine learning (ML) based methods which are less interpretable, but make much fewer functional form assumptions. We find that both ML and economic models are able to predict willingness to pay for risky prospects relatively well. In particular, we show that expected utility theory with probability weighting (a function with 2 parameters for each individual) is able to match the predictive performance of L1 regularized regression and even out-perform the ML model when the number of training decisions per individual is relatively low. In our second experiment we examine the domain of decisions under ambiguity: uncertain decisions where probabilities of outcomes are unknown by the decision-maker. Here L1 regularized regression outperforms commonly used utility-based models. This final result suggests that there is room for theoretical developments in building a better simple-to-use utility-based ambiguity aversion model.
