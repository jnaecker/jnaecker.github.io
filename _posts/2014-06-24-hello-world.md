I created this site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with help from [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole).  I followed [this nice tutorial](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) by [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/).

Here is a formula: $$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$$

Here is some inline math $x_1$.
