title: Hello World

Welcome!  This my personal academic webpage.  I'll be using this site to post my research papers and teaching notes.  I'll also maintain a blog on topics in economics as well as tools for researchers.

#### Who should read the blog? 
The intended audience is social scientists, but I'll try to write the blog to be accessible to any interested reader.

#### What will be covered on the blog?
I'm planning on writing posts on a variety of topics:

- I'll blog about my research as I write new papers.  
- I may also blog about other interesting research papers in the social sciences.
- I'm about to embark on the economic job market for new PhDs.  I'll include advice here from my job market experience that might help future PhD students.
- I'll also include pointers or guides to any tools that I use as part of my research that I think others might benefit from.
