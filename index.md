I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](http://bit.ly/rBrYqX) at [Stanford University](http://bit.ly/tUiqdY).  I use lab and field experiments to test theories of pro-social behavior and risk preferences.

I am on the economics job market this year, so you might be interested in my [curriculum vitae](http://bit.ly/MbllzR) or my [job market page.](http://bit.ly/uFINRT)
