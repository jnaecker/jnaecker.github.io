I'm currently an economist at Google.

Previoulsy, I was an assistant professor in the [Department of Economics](http://www.wesleyan.edu/econ/){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"} at [Wesleyan University](http://www.wesleyan.edu/){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"}, where  I ran the [Digital Experiments Lab](https://naecker-lab.github.io/){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"}. See our [lab Github page](https://github.com/naecker-lab){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"} for research projects and traning materials.

In my academic work, I use lab and field experiments to test theories of pro-social behavior and risk preferences.
