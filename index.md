I'm currently an economist at Google.

Previously, I was an assistant professor in the [Department of Economics](http://www.wesleyan.edu/econ/){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"} at [Wesleyan University](http://www.wesleyan.edu/){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"}, where  I ran the [Digital Experiments Lab](https://naecker-lab.github.io/){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"}. See our [lab Github page](https://github.com/naecker-lab){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"} for research projects and training materials.

In my academic work, I use lab and field experiments to test theories of pro-social behavior and risk preferences.

## Updates

- 2021.12.27: Check out my new paper [Causal Inference from Hypothetical Evaluations](https://bit.ly/hyp-inference-ssrn){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"}, with Doug Bernheim, Dan Bjorkegren, and Michael Pollmann. For a high-level summary, see [this Twitter thread](https://bit.ly/hyp-inference-dan-thread){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"} by Dan.  (Note: This paper is related to a previous working paper, “Non-Choice Evaluations Predict Behavioral Responses to Changes in Economic Conditions"; it uses data from the same lab experiment, but most of the methodological analysis is new, as is the field application.)

- 2019.03.15: My paper [When Fair Isn’t Fair: Understanding Choice Reversals Involving Social Preferences](http://jeffnaecker.com/assets/papers/fairness.pdf){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"} has been accepted for publication at the Journal of Political Economy. See my [blog post](blog/2018/10/16/updated-fairness){:onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'Link', 'Click', this.href);"} about the paper for a short summary.
